Your task is to develop a predictive model that can assess the health risk of residents based on air quality (PM2.5, NO2, CO2) and weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind, etc.) in various U.S. cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goals and requirements of this study are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tCreate a predictive model that accurately forecasts air quality levels based on weather conditions and pollution metrics (PM2.5, NO2, CO2).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tDevelop a highly efficient predictive model that assesses health risks based on urban air quality, weather data, and other relevant factors.\n",

    "You will implement the chosen models for both urban air quality forecasting and health risk prediction and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics such as RMSE, MAPE, and trend analysis. Ensure that the models accurately capture the relationships between weather conditions, pollution metrics, and health outcomes and assess their effectiveness across different time periods and urban areas.\"\n",
