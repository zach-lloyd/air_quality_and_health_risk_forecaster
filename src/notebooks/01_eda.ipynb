XGBoost can quickly provide these and many other metrics to assess its performance, meaning it is well-equipped to provide a robust analysis of the algorithm’s performance. Furthermore, XGBoost provides an extensive set of hyperparameters that can be tuned to improve the results [2]. Consequently, it will offer significant room for experimentation to optimize performance. Finally, the problem statement requests a “highly efficient predictive model”. XGBoost utilizes parallel processing to analyze large datasets quickly [3], enabling it to handle large urban datasets more efficiently than traditional sequential boosting methods. Thus, XGBoost is a highly efficient predictive model."
